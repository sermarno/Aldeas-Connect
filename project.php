            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Aldeas Inteligentes, Bienestar Sostenible is a Mexican Federal 
                Government project actively working to provide digital access 
                to rural and isolated communities across Mexico. Having already 
                connected 83 communities, this project provides community residents 
                with a range of wireless internet connection methods, STEM training, 
                and support in community development projects aimed towards improving 
                education, commerce, health, welfare, and other developmental aspects. 
                <br><br>
                Currently, administrators rely on project updates through a questionnaire 
                completed by residents once every three months, but with long gaps between 
                check-ins and no effective communication tool, it is challenging to maintain 
                contact with the residents and ensure that the projects are receiving the 
                attention they need for their completion. If there isn’t an effective tool 
                to frequently track the status of community projects and reach out to community 
                members, residents miss opportunities to gain recognition for their work, inspire 
                greater involvement, and secure additional funding or support for their community 
                development.

            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p>
                Our goal as a team is to create an information system that manages 
                Smart Village operations, enabling communities to showcase their projects on an 
                official website and to stay in contact with curators for assistance, encouraging 
                greater participation and ultimately increasing their potential for further development. 
                Including a visualization of community projects enhances transparency through a clear way 
                for the public to see what projects are being worked on through the provided technology
                and assistance. By providing administrators and residents a communication tool directly through
                the website, users can get immediate responses to their concerns or questions.
