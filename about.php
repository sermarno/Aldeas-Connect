<h1>Our Mission</h1>

<p> Our main goal is to provide free internet access to rural communities around the country of Mexico. So far,
    we
    have been able to provide free internet access to over 80 communities in various states throughout the
    country.
    Each community works together on a project ranging from health, education, and tourism to name a few. Giving
    these communities the tools to improve their surroundings builds their confidence and allows them to tap
    into
    their full potential as people.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p> We believe that internet access is a human right. As technology progresses, internet access has become
    essential
    if an individual wants to participate in society. Providing free internet access to these communities in
    need
    allows them to learn valuable technical skills as well as build a strong bond with their peers as they work
    on
    projects together that will benefit their community for years to come.</p>
