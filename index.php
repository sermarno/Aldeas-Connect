    <p>Aldeas Inteligentes is a transformative initiative by the Mexican Federal Government aimed at providing digital access to rural and isolated communities across Mexico. 
    By connecting 83 communities with wireless internet, offering STEM training, and supporting community development projects, Aldeas Inteligentes is enhancing education, commerce, health, and overall welfare.
    Our information system will change how rural communities track progress, showcase their achievements, and connect with supporters.
    From improving education and healthcare to boosting local commerce, we're creating a platform that helps amplify the voices and aspirations of Mexico's underrated regions.</p>
